# DeepSeaROV
The deep sea is one of Earth's least explored frontiers, housing an extraordinary diversity of biota. However, studying these ecosystems is challenging due to their inaccessibility and the vast amounts of data generated during exploration missions. Automated image classification of deep-sea biota can significantly aid researchers in cataloging and analyzing these unique organisms.

This project presents a meticulously curated dataset comprising 4,158 images captured by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) during deep-sea expeditions. The images feature 62 distinct classes of biota, including rare and previously undocumented species. Each image has undergone rigorous human-in-the-loop quality control processes to ensure accurate labeling and high annotation standards.
